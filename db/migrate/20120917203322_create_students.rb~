      question1: 'I started Cardtorial earlier this year, inspired by my desire to express myself creatively and create something truly special to share with friends and family; I really wanted to make something that would make people smile!  Ive always loved cards & written communication (heck, I even keep sweet post-its) and Cardtorial really is!',
      question2: 'To date, Ive prototyped and crafted my cards using the laser cutters at Techshop, a shared workspace in San Francisco.  As I grow, its important to me that the cards continue to be crafted sustainably, right here in the US. Proceeds of this Kickstarter will go towards buying a laser cutter so I can keep production in-house and know that the cards are supporting our local economy.',
