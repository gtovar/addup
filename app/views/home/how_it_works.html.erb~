          <h2>Browse through profiles of extraordinary students</h2>
          <p>Discover the profiles of students who have pledged to use their
skills, talents and passion to add up to their communities. Whether
you are simply inspired by a student’s story or you come to Add Up
to contribute to students you know, who share your nationality,
your alma mater, or your cause, we are sure you will find a student
who captures your attention and earns your contribution.
          </p>
<p>*In the near future, we will make browsing easier by enabling you to search for
students by nationality, school, program of study and cause.</p>

          <h2>Invest in students and their social projects</h2>
          <p>Your money will go directly to the student’s university towards her
tuition. Your investment is non-traditional and you won’t receive a
financial return. Investing in a student will instead earn returns for
society by boosting a student’s confidence in her capacity to have
a positive impact in her community and encouraging her to keep
adding up in the future. Your money will not be paid back to you,
but 40% of it will be paid forward by the student to other students
on the Add Up platform – the second pledge in the Student Honor
Code. This way, your contribution will carry on.

          <h2>Choose to receive updates on your student’s activities</h2>
          <p>Students who receive money through Add Up also make a third
and final pledge to keep their sponsors informed throughout the
year regarding the progress of their social project, as well as their
academic pursuits. This way, if you opt in, you will be able to see
how the student you supported is contributing to her community.

          <h2>Crowdfund your scholarship by running an engaged campaign</h2>
          <p>Share your Add Up profile through Facebook, Twitter, mail and
good-old-fashioned word of mouth (to those friends, family
members, and supporters who may be behind on the whole internet
revolution thing). Be creative! Make a Facebook Cause and invite
your friends to join it or send out an e-card. However you go about
it, don’t forget to direct people to your Add Up profile where
they can help fund your scholarship, which goes directly to your
university. Your immediate network is the starting point and Add
Up will expand your network with alumni and fellow nationals.
From there, every recommendation and every dollar adds up.
          </p>
<p>*Add Up utilizes PayPal to facilitate payments.</p>
