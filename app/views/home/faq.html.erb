<p>ADD UP seeks to recognize and motivate the community service efforts of international students studying for their higher education degrees in the US.</p>
<p>Many intelligent and talented students earn their degrees and yet lack the confidence to utilize their skills and abilities in ways that can make a positive impact on their society. With the incentive of getting complementary funds towards their university’s cost of attendance, Addup.org invites students to reflect on and identify their skills and abilities, what change they are passionate about making in their community, and how they can use those talents to contribute to that change. The tangible benefit may come in dollar signs, but the security gained from knowing that people believe in them and their capacity to have a positive impact on others is the real reward that carries on.</p>

<p>ADD UP is a platform where service-oriented, international students studying for their higher education degrees in the United States can connect with sponsors who value the impacts of both quality higher education and grassroots community service. </p>
<p>Sponsors add up to a student’s scholarship when they feel drawn to the student’s service mission, course of study, or cause. Empowered by the support of their sponsors, students then add up to their communities through any number of different community-building endeavors.  <%= render partial: 'student_applications/ideas' %>In the end, everybody wins.

<p>The United States is home to many of the best universities in the world and thus attracts hundreds of thousands of international students seeking higher education degrees each year. Though rising tuition costs affect both American and international students struggling to fund their educational goals, international students do not have access to federal and state grants and scholarships, nor are they eligible for many private scholarships that are available only to US citizens. Recognizing the lack of financial aid options available to international students, ADD UP seeks to partly fill this void by providing a crowdfunding platform which enables service-oriented international students to raise complementary funds towards their tuition and use their unique abilities to improve the community in which they study.</p>
<p>In the near future, we hope to expand the platform for American students, as we recognize that, despite the variety of financial aid options, funding their higher education is still a struggle for millions of students each year.</p>

<p>Great question! There are three things every ADD UP scholarship recipient does after their campaign and which are specified on the ADD UP Student Honor Code.</p>
<p>First, add up! Follow through on your service initiative.</p>
<p>Second, keep your sponsors informed of your service efforts – they want to know! Your ADD UP profile will continue to be available after your campaign is over, so feel free to use the social media resources available on your page to keep your sponsors updated. Blog about your progress, upload pictures, share whatever you’d like with your sponsors. It’s really up to you, but remember the commitment you made of keeping them informed. </p>
<p>Third, add up to other students’ education in the future! As part of the Honor Code, you pledge to give 40% of what you, the student, were able to raise in your own campaign within five years after your graduation to other students through ADD UP. This is a way for the donation you received to carry on and to keep empowering students to add up to their communities. </p>

          <div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapse26">
            <div class="accordion-inner">
<p>Not entirely. Though the money collected through AddUp.org is a donation/gift from sponsors, you pledge to donate at least 40% of what you raise to other students through ADD UP in the future (within 5 years of graduating) by signing the Honor Code. This is how ADD UP encourages sponsors to be more generous with their donations, since they know that their donation will carry on.</p>

<p>Legally, nothing. However, ADD UP takes your personal commitment and Honor Code seriously. If you wish to use ADD UP to raise money in the future, you will not be allowed to do so. We will publish on the website and in our newsletters updates of students who have fulfilled their commitments, so your sponsors, family and friends will know whether you fulfilled them or not. It is common courtesy and a way to maintain good relationships to follow through on your commitments.</p>

<p>For example, a contribution from a sponsor in the U.S. will incur a total fee of 6% plus 30 cents. These fees – which are taken from the total amount donated and are not additional charges to sponsors – are less than crowdfunding industry standards (typically 7.5%). </p>

<p>No. Students themselves – despite having the ability to make immense, positive differences in their communities – are not non-profit institutions.

<p>Yes. Your decision to add up to a student’s education is made for any number of personal reasons. Whether or not that student reaches his or her funding goal does not change anything.

<p>ADD UP goes to great lengths to ensure that students actually attend their stated universities by verifying that they are enrolled.

<p>After you add up, you will receive confirmation that your donation has been accepted. Once the campaign is over, you will receive confirmation of the deposit to the student’s university account. You can choose to receive newsletters from ADD UP informing you of updates regarding the student’s service commitments and, of course, you will be kept informed by the student through the social media resources available on Addup.org.</p>

<p>There is no need to have a PayPal account (though it will only take a few seconds to create one once you are in the process of making a donation). ADD UP simply uses PayPal to manage transactions and to ensure that they are completed in a secure manner.</p>
