    <p>At Add Up we believe in making quality higher education accessible to all. We are also convinced that the only way to exploit the transformational power of education for the advancement of societies is to develop in students a genuine sense of empathy, accountability and empowerment towards their communities.</p>
    <p>With this vision, Add Up takes an innovative turn on the proven success of the crowdfunding model and the power of social media, to make the dream of studying in the US accessible to students all around the world while deepening their sense of responsibility to give back.</p>
    <p>AddUp is the easy and secure way for international students to raise funds towards their higher education. Donors add up towards their tuition and student���s pay it forward by adding up to a cause with their creativity, abilities or time.</p>
