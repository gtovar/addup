    <h5 class="bold top-space">ABOUT US</h5>
    <h6>
At Add Up, we believe that our world needs educated people who not only want to make an
impact on their communities, but who also genuinely believe that they have the capacity to do
so!
</h6>
<p>
The innovative turn Add Up takes on the proven success of the crowdfunding model and the
power of social media does much more than help students raise complementary funds towards
their tuition in an easy and secure way. It also raises their confidence in their ability to be
a force for positive change. The tangible benefit may come in dollar signs, but the security
gained from knowing that others believe in them and their philanthropic pursuits is the real
reward that carries on.
</p>
<p>
  The model is a simple one. Donors are inspired by students and invest in their educational goals, with the money going directly to the student’s university account. The return on investment does not go back to the donor, but rather gets paid forward by the students in two ways: first, as they continue to add up to their communities with their abilities, talents and time and secondly, as they return 40% of what they raised to other students through the Add Up platform over time.
