        <p>AddUp seeks out students who are accepted or currently enrolled in U.S. universities and who are commited to using their education to have a positive impact on their communities. For now, we are accepting applications from students hailing from Mexico and South Korea, but we are hoping to expand soon.

        <p>1 Students complete an application sharing information about their educational goals and social cause.</p>
        <p>2 They must also sign an honor code promising to fulfill their service project and to give back 40% of the money raised to other students on Add Up within the 10 years of graduating.</p>
        <p>3 Add Up validates that the student is indeed enrolled at the university and makes sure their profile meets Add Ups's requirements and standards.</p>

      <div id="how3" class="how-step">
        <img src="assets/how/how3.png" alt="" />
        <p>Students then use the free social media tools provided by Add Up’s platform to get relatives, friends, alumni or fellow nationals who share a common regard for the quality of a US education to endorse their educational goals and social cause and contribute towards their tuition.</p>

        <p>Simultaneously, Add Up’s ambassadors promote Add Up to with alumni of the student’s university, people from their home country, and/or advocates of their social cause, thus expanding the student’s potential network of donors. </p>

        <p>Through contributions starting from $1, anyone can be inspired by a student’s story and cause. Once inspired, it takes less than 3 minutes to add up to his education. Donors can further help a student by sharing his story on Facebook, Twitter or by e-mail. </p>

        <p>At the end of the campaign, Add Up pays the money collected money for the  student's tuition directly to the university.</p>
