          <h2>Crowdfund your scholarship by running an engaged campaign</h2>
          <p>Share your Add Up profile through Facebook, Twitter, mail and good-old-fashioned word of mouth (to those friends, family members, and supporters who may be behind on the whole internet revolution thing). Be creative! Make a Facebook Cause and invite your friends to join it or send out an e-card. However you go about it, donâ€™t forget to direct people to your Add Up profile where they can help fund your scholarship, which goes directly to your university. Your immediate network is the starting point and Add Up will expand your network with alumni and fellow nationals. From there, every recommendation and every dollar adds up.
