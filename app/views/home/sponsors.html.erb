<p>Maybe you are a family member or friend (or friend of a friend) of a student and you would like to empower them in their educational and service endeavors.</p>
<p>Maybe you are an alumnus of a student’s university and you are interested in the contributions they will make to your alma mater and the community. </p>
<p>Maybe you are passionate about a particular cause and you feel inspired by a student’s plan to utilize his or her education to advance your cause’s mission through their study and/or service work. </p>
<p>Or maybe you are one of the many people who realize how important it is to have knowledgeable, energetic, and passionate students who believe in their capacity to make the world a better place.</p>
Whatever your motivation, there’s no bad reason to add up.

<p>Once you decide that you would like to add up to a student’s education, it’s as easy as buying a birthday gift online. Though ADD UP utilizes PayPal as its payment processor, it is not necessary to have a PayPal account. </p>
<p>It doesn’t have to stop with financial contributions, either. You can always write encouraging notes on the profile page of the students whom you support and, of course, ADD UP encourages you to share their story with your own social network in an effort to drum up further support.  </p>

<p>The money raised by the student’s campaign, minus fees, goes directly to the student’s university. This ensures that your donation is used for the educational purpose for which you intended it.</p>

<p>ADD UP utilizes PayPal, which has processing fees of 2.5% + $0.30 per domestic (U.S.) transaction and 3.5% + $0.30 per international transaction. Additionally, ADD UP collects 3.5% from the total amount raised to cover our normal business costs and to enable our growth.</p>
<p>For example, a contribution from a sponsor in the U.S. will incur a total fee of 6% plus 30 cents. These fees – which are taken from the total amount donated and are not additional charges to sponsors – are less than crowdfunding industry standards (typically 7.5%). </p>

          <div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapse32">
            <div class="accordion-inner">
<p>No. Students themselves – despite having the ability to make immense, positive differences in their communities – are not non-profit institutions. Since the money raised goes towards a student’s scholarship (ultimately for the benefit of the student), adding up to a student’s scholarship is not recognized as a tax-deductible gift.</p>

          <div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapse35">
            <div class="accordion-inner">
<p>Yes. Your decision to add up to a student’s education is made for any number of personal reasons. Whether or not that student reaches his or her funding goal does not change anything. The student still has the responsibility to keep you informed of their progress as they take action on their service plan.</p>

<p>ADD UP goes to great lengths to ensure that students actually attend their stated universities by verifying that they are enrolled. In the rare case that a student transfers schools or drops out before the end of the year of their campaign, sponsors will be notified and the money donated will go into an ADD UP General Fund and will be used to fund other extraordinary students.</p>

<p>After you add up, you will receive confirmation that your donation has been accepted. Once the campaign is over, you will receive confirmation of the deposit to the student’s university account. You can choose to receive newsletters from ADD UP informing you of updates regarding the student’s service commitments and, of course, you will be kept informed by the student through the social media resources available on Addup.org.</p>

<p>There is no need to have a PayPal account (though it will only take a few seconds to create one once you are in the process of making a donation). ADD UP simply uses PayPal to manage transactions and to ensure that they are completed in a secure manner.</p>
